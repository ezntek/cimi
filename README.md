# CimiLang

scuffed scripting language (evolution of `ezntek/beancode`), basically what beancode2 was supposed to be.

## Etymology

Cimi means stupid in Rikatisyï (`/ri.kʰa.ˈtʰi.ɕy/`), a conlang made by my good friend [Kasreti](https://github.com/Kasreti). Cimi is pronounced `/tɕʰimi/` or like `Chimi` in English.
