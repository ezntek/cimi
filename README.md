# CimiLang

A very stupid programming language used for me to learn compiler engineering. Get ready to see some of the most cursed code on the planet.

## Etymology

Cimi means stupid in Rikatisyï (`/ri.kʰa.ˈtʰi.ɕy/`), a conlang made by my great friend [Kasreti](https://github.com/Kasreti) that I love very, very much. All the good English names were taken up, so I chose Rikatisyï instead. Cimi is pronounced `/tɕʰimi/` or like `Chimi` in English, I like in Bee but shorter.

## Running

`cargo run`
